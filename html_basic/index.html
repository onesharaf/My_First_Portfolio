    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>

    <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
    <p>This is the main page of my new website. I am learning how to structure content using HTML, which is the skeleton of every webpage. It's exciting to see how different tags create different elements on the page.</p>

    <!-- Heading Level 2 -->
    <h2>About This Page</h2>

    <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
    <p>On this page, we are exploring several key HTML tags. We have paragraphs, like this one, and we also have different levels of headings to organize our topics clearly. Learning to nest tags is also important, like making an image clickable.</p>

    <!-- Heading Level 3 -->
    <h3>Key Elements Added</h3>

    <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
    <p>So far, we have added headings of levels 1, 2, and 3. We have also included several paragraphs of text to act as content. The next element is a clickable image, which combines an anchor tag (for the link) and an image tag.</p>

    <!-- A Clickable Image -->
      <ul> <li><a href="https://www.alxafrica.com/"></li>
        <li><img src="https://i.ibb.co/gTDZZT8/ALX-Logo-07.png" alt="The ALX logo, which is red and says ALX"></li>
     <li><p>The image above is the ALX logo. I've wrapped it in an anchor tag (a link) so that if you click on it, it will take you to the official ALX website. I also added an 'alt' attribute to the image, which is important for accessibility as it describes the image for screen readers.</p>
</li>
 <p><a> href="tweets.html" my tweets></a>
    </p>
    

</ul>
